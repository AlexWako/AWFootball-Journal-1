# AWFootball-Journal-1

Description:
This is the first of many journals for my analysis in the football world.
I will attempt to use the knowledge I learned from school and outside sources and apply it to a data analysis journal called AW Football.
A project I do during my spare time, the speed at which my work is updated changes day to day.
As I have zero experience in the professional world of data science, I try my best to find valuable information that viewers would otherwise never find 
in the public databases of football.
The goal of my projects is to eventually get a job in the footballing world as a data anaylst, and I hope these journals can showcase what I am capable of.
Thank you for reading the README file and hopefully you enjoy me content.
